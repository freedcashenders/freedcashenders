Interest rates on loans fluctuate significantly with the rest of the finance market. Because they have increased over the last year, even borrowers with good credit could still face rates over 10 percent. You are unlikely to find any lender offering an APR under 7 percent.

This also affects what lenders and borrowers consider a low rate. While it wonâ€™t be as low as it might have been a few years ago, it can still be a competitive rate when compared to the rest of the current market.

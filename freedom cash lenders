Low-interest personal loans are just like any other loan — they just cost less. You can find competitive low rates with online lenders, banks and credit unions. However, you may need to meet some additional requirements to score the absolute lowest rate available.
Online lenders
Online lenders offer low rates and quick applications. In many cases, you can apply for a loan and, if approved, receive your funds within a week. This makes them quick, but many reserve their lowest rates for borrowers with extremely strong credit profiles. And if you do manage to score the minimum APR offered, you will need to sign up for automatic payments — in most cases — to truly get the low interest rate advertised on the lender’s website.
